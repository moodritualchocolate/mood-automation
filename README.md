# MOOD CREATIVE OS

**Not a banner generator. Not a prompt wrapper. Not a Canva clone.**

An autonomous creative operating system. V1 ships one engine: the
ENERGY static banner engine.

The user provides one input: the formula (ENERGY). Optionally a
campaign mode (Editorial / Documentary / Performance / Emotional /
Minimal / Aggressive / Luxury / Product-focused). The system thinks
the rest.

## Architecture

V1 is wired exactly the way the future system needs to think.
Engines are isolated; the pipeline is the only place that knows the
order. New formulas and new outputs (carousels, video, landing pages)
plug into the same shape.

```
human truth → emotional tension → campaign concept → composition
   → image → typography → CTA → critique → rejection → export → memory
```

### Engines (`src/engines/*`)

| # | Engine              | Role                                                         |
|---|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Human State         | Picks one of 59 ENERGY states. Rotates by family + fatigue.  |
| 2 | Human Truth         | Writes the sharp truth beneath the state.                    |
| 3 | Creative Director   | Decides hook, focal, pacing, product role, layout, restraint.|
| 4 | Composition Planner | Plans focal/typo/product zones + eye flow.                   |
| 5 | Image Generation    | Photographic-scene only. No text. No logos.                  |
| 6 | Product Integration | Refuses pasted PNG behavior. Product lives in the scene.     |
| 7 | Typography          | Hebrew, RTL, sized by dominance. SVG/HTML — never in image.  |
| 8 | CTA                 | One intentional Hebrew CTA, styled per direction.            |
| 9 | Scroll-Stop Critic  | Scores ten signals. Approves or rejects.                     |
| 10 | Memory             | Fatigue, repetition avoidance, state scores.                 |
| 11 | Imperfection       | Controlled realism per formula. ENERGY = pressure + interrupt.|
| 12 | Rejection          | Routes reject-image vs reject-concept regenerations.         |
| 13 | Export             | SVG composite → PNG (resvg).                                 |

The cognition layer (`src/cognition/claude.ts`) wraps Anthropic's SDK
and is used by the truth, direction, typography, and critic engines.
Image providers (`src/engines/image/providers/*`) abstract OpenAI's
gpt-image-1.

## Runtime

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY + OPENAI_API_KEY for real cognition / images
npm run dev           # http://localhost:3000
```

The system runs end-to-end **without keys** — every engine ships a
curated bank fallback (states, truths, headlines) and a cinematic
SVG stub image provider. Add keys to switch to real cognition.

### CLI smoke test

```bash
MOOD_FORCE_STUBS=1 npm run engines:test
# writes out-banner.svg and out-banner.png in repo root
```

## What V1 is NOT

- No video, no carousel, no reels.
- No landing pages, no schedulers, no publishing.
- No prompt input. The user is not a creative director.
- No "premium" — the system optimises for **memorable**.

## Hebrew

All consumer-facing copy renders RTL in Hebrew via SVG `direction="rtl"`
+ Heebo (with system fallback). The headline bank
(`src/engines/typography/hebrew-headlines.ts`) ships one curated line
per state. Cognition can override with live Claude output.

## Memory

`./data/memory/memory.json` (configurable via `MOOD_MEMORY_DIR`). Tracks
recent states, layouts, hooks, and per-state critique scores. The Human
State selector reads it on every run for fatigue / rotation.
